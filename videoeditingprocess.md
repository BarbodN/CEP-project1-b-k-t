# Software being used
- I intend on using PowerPoint to make the slides
- CapCut to edit the video itself.

#Steps to carry out this process
- [ ] Get script/notes on the chosen topic from Barbod
- [ ] Start the PowerPoint presentation using Microsoft PowerPoint
- [ ] Have Timmy complete the voice-over

Instead of powerpoint I'm going to use Canva.
