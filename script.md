# Topic: How AI Is Hurting Programming Efficiency and Quality


## Script:

The rush to adopt AI in software development is creating a surprising challenge. Developers are writing code faster than ever, thanks to AI assistants, but this speed comes at a cost. Legacy processes downstream, like testing, security, and deployment, are struggling to keep up.
#### [insert: developer using AI]
According to a report from Harness, while AI has supercharged code creation, most organisations haven’t developed the rest of the software delivery lifecycle at the same pace. This imbalance has created what the report calls the “AI Velocity Paradox.”


Here’s what that means: 63 percent of organisations report shipping code to production more frequently since adopting AI. But more code doesn’t always mean faster delivery overall. In fact, pushing more code into pipelines that aren’t fully automated often slows things down and introduces new risks.
#### [insert: picture of balloon getting squeezed]
In the report, 67 percent of development teams describe AI coding assistants like “squeezing a balloon as work just moves from one side to another.” Teams are using, on average, 8 to 10 different AI tools. Over a third of teams use even more, creating complexity and mental fatigue. Many developers report that constant context switching kills productivity.


The problem isn’t just inconvenient, it's risky. Automation in coding workflows averages 51 percent, but continuous delivery, where the code actually reaches production, is only six percent fully automated. This gap means 45 percent of AI-generated deployments lead to problems, and 72 percent of organisations have already had at least one production incident.

So, what’s the path forward? Organisations need to pair upstream AI speed with downstream intelligence. That means investing in AI-powered testing, security scanning, and deployment verification, not just code generation.
#### [insert: balanced scale with speed vs safety]
The report highlights a target state called “Velocity Leaders”: organisations that combine high AI adoption with high downstream automation. For them, AI isn’t just a productivity boost, it's a competitive advantage, allowing coders to move fast without breaking things.


In short, AI has given code writing a boost but without upgrading the other parts of code development, that boost can be dangerous. The future of software development depends on balancing velocity with resilience, so organisations can deliver code faster, safer, and smarter.
